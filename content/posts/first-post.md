My observation on the 'Trauma-Politics' link: The U.S. might be so adventurous in its foreign policy simply because the mainland lacks genuine war trauma. Most countries that suffered on their own soil during WWII shifted to the Left, but China is the exception.

In China, the political 'Left' has wrapped around to become the Far Right. The reality is that the average young person's political alignment is essentially 'Chinazi,' though they are completely unaware of it. Years of hate-based education have turned them into fanatical nationalists.

They constantly accuse Japan and Korea of being 'culture thieves' while claiming to be the orthodox source. Yet, in reality, preservation and cultural evolution are far better handled in Taiwan, Japan, and Korea.

The narrative relies on the artificial construct of the 'Chinese Nation.' It retroactively claims all historical dynasties and territories as 'ours,' creating a binary mindset: foreign culture is either 'stolen from us' or belongs to 'our descendants.'

What’s truly disturbing is that even seemingly normal people can, in a split second, display a terrifying, almost inhuman desire for war.
